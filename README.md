# Space Paranoid ðŸš€ðŸ‘½

This shmup retrogame is the result of the first project for Ironhack Madrid WebDev Bootcamp. 
It was developed in just 5 days, as an exercise to put into practice our programming knowledge, and our problem solving skills.
Entirely developed in vanilla JS and HTML Canvas, it was inspired by those good old videogames I used to play during my childhood.
A dream come true and and a cool fun little game to play ðŸ˜Š
